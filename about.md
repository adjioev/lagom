# Summary

I have gained comprehensive experience in all aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle including business analysis, architecture design and research and development. I wish to work within a cutting edge software development team and apply my skills to help achieve excellence. I also aspire to work on open source software (OSS) projects and support not-for-profit organizations.
